                <p>The Camino Finisterre is a 90km trail from Santiago to Finisterra, on the western coast of Spain. The three- to four-day journey traverses the rugged countryside of Galicia, with its Celtic heritage.
                    <br> Medieval pilgrims believed that Finisterre (Latin, meaning “the end of the world”) was literally the end of the world.

               <hr>
            <p>The Camino Primitivo is a <b>321 km </b>pilgrimage through Northern Spain, starting in Oviedo and finishing at the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. The route crosses sparsely populated mountainous areas, with impressive lanscapes filled with natural beauty and almost no asphalt stretches (hurray for our feet!).
                <br> In addition, the historical and patrimonial resources are abundant, especially in the two monumental cities that we visit on our route, Oviedo and Lugo, as well as Compostela itself, which awaits us on our arrival.

        <h3>... "and I took the road less travelled"</h3>
        <p>Although the Via de la Plata (the Silver route) follows an old Roman road towards the metal mines in northern
            Spain, its name has nothing to do with silver. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The name is most likely derived from the Latin word “platea” meaning wide road or “Lapidata” meaning stone
            road. Another possible origin is the Arabic word Balatta meaning road.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The route was used well before the Romans as well, in prehistory this route was used by garmers to move
            domesticated animals in the summer from the south to north and vice-versa.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Later the route was well known for traders who came to the southern ports of the Iberian Peninsula and traded
            ceramics and jewelry for raw materials from the north.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Via de la Plata was used by different migratory groups to invade and in the 8th century it allowed the
            Moors to advance into northern Spain and fill up the power vacuum left in the peninsula by the Romans.
            Later, this same route was used by Spanish for the Reconquista. </p>
